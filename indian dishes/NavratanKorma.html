            <h1>Navratan Korma</h1>
            <p>his navratan korma recipe is an Indian vegetable curry with nuts, paneer cheese, and an adjustable list
                of vegetables. It is in a tomato-cream sauce as opposed to the usual yogurt-based sauce. Navratan means
                "nine gems," so choose nine of the vegetable, nuts, and paneer ingredients; you can leave out the
                elements you don't want to use, or add them all so it is "ten gems" if you wish.</p>

            <h2>Directions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Place mixed nuts in the skillet, cook and
                    stir until golden brown, and set aside. Stir onion into the skillet, and cook until tender. Mix in
                    garlic paste and ginger paste, and cook 1 minute. Stir in tomato sauce, cayenne pepper, turmeric,
                    coriander, and garam masala. Pour in water, and mix in raisins, carrots, green bell pepper, beans,
                    peas, and potatoes. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, and simmer 20 minutes, until potatoes are
                    tender.</li>
                <li>Heat remaining oil in a separate skillet over medium-high heat, and cook the paneer on both sides,
                    until golden brown. Drain on paper towels. Place in a bowl with enough hot water to cover for about
                    2 minutes to soften, then stir into the skillet with the vegetables.</li>
                <li>Stir milk and cream into the skillet with the vegetables and paneer. Bring to a boil, and continue
                    cooking, 2 to 3 minutes. Season with salt to taste.</li>
